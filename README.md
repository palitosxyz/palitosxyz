# Palitos.XYZ 
 
Palitos.XYZ  is an online platform to learn robotics and programming in a practical and fun way using virtual ice cream sticks.  
 
The project allows users to assemble structures and robots by dragging 3D sticks and interacting with them in a virtual environment close to the real world. 
 
## How it Works 
 
- The virtual sticks can be dragged and connected in different geometric shapes. 
- It is possible to rotate and move the sticks interactively. 
- Everything happens in real time in an immersive 3D environment. 
- Projects can be shared and viewed by other users.
